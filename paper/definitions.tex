\subsection{Shortest Common Superstring Problem}
\label{sec:def_scs}
For a string $s$, by $|s|$ we denote the length of $s$. 
For strings~$s$ and~$t$, by $\overlap(s,t)$
we denote the longest suffix of~$s$ that is also 
a~prefix of~$t$. By $\pref(s,t)$
we denote the first $|s|-|\overlap(s,t)|$ symbols of $s$.
Similarly, $\suff(s,t)$ is the last
$|t|-|\overlap(s,t)|$ symbols of~$t$. 
By $\pref(s)$ and $\suff(s)$ we denote, respectively,
the first and the last $|s|-1$ symbols of~$s$. See Figure~\ref{fig:overlap} for a~visual explanation. We denote the empty string by $\varepsilon$.

Throughout the paper by ${\cal S}=\{s_1, \dots, s_n\}$ we denote
the set of~$n$ input strings. We assume that no input string is a~substring of another (such a~substring can be removed from $\mathcal{S}$ on the preprocessing stage). Note that SCS is a~{\em permutation problem}: to find a~shortest string containing all $s_i$'s in a~{\em given order} one just
overlaps the strings in this order, see Figure~\ref{fig:permutation}. (This simple observation relates SCS to other permutation problems, including various versions of the Traveling Salesman Problem.) It will prove convenient to view the SCS problem as a~problem of finding an optimum permutation.
It should be noted at the same time that the correspondence between permutations and superstrings is not one-to-one: there are superstrings that do not correspond to any permutation. For example, the concatenation of input strings is clearly a~superstring, but it ignores the fact that neighbor strings may have non-trivial overlaps and for this reason may fail to correspond to a~permutation. Still, clearly, any {\em shortest} superstring corresponds to a~permutation.

\subsection{Hierarchical Graph}
\label{sec:def_hier}
%\begin{definition}[hierarchical graph]
For a~set of strings~${\cal S}$, the~\emph{hierarchical graph} $HG=(V,E)$ is a~weighted directed graph with $V=\{v \colon \text{$v$ is a~substring of some $s \in {\cal S}$}\}$. For every $v \in V,\, v \neq \varepsilon$, the set of arcs~$E$ contains an {\em up-arc} $(\pref(v), v)$ of weight~1 and a {\em down-arc} $(v, \suff(v))$ of weight~0. The meaning of an up-arc is appending one symbol to the end of the current string (and that is why it has weight~1), whereas the meaning of a down-arc is cutting down one symbol from the beginning of the current string.
%\end{definition}
%
Figure~\ref{fig:hgex}(a) gives an example of the hierarchical graph and shows that the terminology of up- and down-arcs comes from placing all the strings of the same length at the same level, where the $i$-th level contains strings of length~$i$.  In all the figures in this paper, the input strings are shown in rectangles, while all other vertices are ellipses.

It has length~9, corresponds to the~permutation $({\tt aaa}, {\tt aec}, {\tt cae}, {\tt eee})$, and defines the~walk of length~9 shown in black.}
\label{fig:hgex}
\end{figure}

What we are looking for in this graph is a shortest
walk from $\varepsilon$ to $\varepsilon$ going
through all the nodes from~$\mathcal{S}$.
It is not difficult to see that the length of a~walk 
from $\varepsilon$ to $\varepsilon$ equals the 
length of the string spelled by this walk. 
This is just because each up-arc has 
weight~$1$ and adds one symbol to 
the current string. See Figure~\ref{fig:hgex}(b) for an~example.
%For example, in the graph of Fiure.~\ref{fig:hgexfirst} 
%a~walk $\varepsilon\to{\tt b}\to{\tt ba}
%\to{\tt bab}\to{\tt ab}\to{\tt abc}
%\to{\tt abca}\to{\tt bca}\to{\tt ca}\to{\tt a}
%\to\varepsilon$ has length $5$ and spells 
%a~string {\tt babca} 
%of length~$5$ in a~natural way.\todo{Update this when you update the figure.}

Hence, the SCS problem is equivalent to finding a~shortest closed walk from $\varepsilon$ to $\varepsilon$ that visits all nodes from~${\cal S}$. Note that a walk may contain repeated nodes and arcs. The multiset of arcs of such a~walk must be Eulerian (each vertex must have the same in- and out-degree, and the set of arcs must be connected). It will prove convenient to define an~{\em Eulerian solution} in a~hierarchical graph as an~Eulerian multiset of arcs~$D$ that goes through $\varepsilon$ and all nodes from~${\cal S}$. Given such a~solution~$D$, one can easily recover an Eulerian cycle (that might not be unique). This cycle spells a~superstring of~${\cal S}$ of the same length as~$D$. Figure~\ref{fig:hgex}(c) shows an~optimal Eulerian solution.

A solution to SCS defines a permutation $(s_{i_1}, \dotsc, s_{i_n})$ of the input strings, and this permutation naturally gives a~``zig-zag'' Eulerian solution in the hierarchical graph:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:zigzag}
\varepsilon \to s_{i_1} \to \overlap(s_{i_1}, s_{i_2}) \to s_{i_2} \to
\overlap(s_{i_2}, s_{i_3}) \to \dotsb \to \overlap(s_{i_{n-1}}, s_{i_n}) \to s_{i_n} \to \varepsilon \, .
\end{align}
This Eulerian solution is shown schematically in Figure~\ref{fig:hgperm}(a). This schematic illustration is over simplified as the shown path usually has many self-intersections. Still, this point of view is helpful in understanding the algorithms presented later in the text. 
Figure~\ref{fig:hgperm}(b) shows an ``untangled'' optimal Eulerain solution from Figure~\ref{fig:hgex}(c): by contracting nodes with equal labels into the same node, one gets exactly the solution from Figure~\ref{fig:hgex}(c).

Not every Eulerian solution in the hierarchical graph has a~nice zig-zag
structure described above. In the next section, we introduce a~normalization procedure (that we call collapsing)
that allows us to focus on nice Eulerian solutions only. 

\subsection{Normalizing a~Solution}
\label{sec:def_normal}
In this section, we describe a~natural way of normalizing an~Eulerian solution~$D$. Informally, it can be viewed as follows.
Imagine that all arcs of~$D$ form one~circular thread, and that there is a~nail in every node~$s \in {\cal S}$ corresponding to an input string. We apply {\em gravitation} to the thread, i.e., we replace every pair of arcs $(\pref(v), v)$, $(v, \suff(v))$ 
with a~pair $(\pref(v), \pref(\suff(v)))$, $(\pref(\suff(v)), \suff(v))$, if there is no nail in~$v$ and if this does not disconnect~$D$. We call this {\em collapsing}, see Figure~\ref{fig:collapsing}.

\caption{Collapsing a~pair of arcs is replacing a~pair of dashed arcs with a~pair of solid arcs: general case (left) and example (right). The~``physical meaning'' of this transformation is that to get {\tt bac} from {\tt aba} one needs to cut~{\tt a} from the beginning and append~{\tt c} to the end and these two operations commute.}
\label{fig:collapsing}
\end{figure}

A~formal pseudocode of the collapsing procedure is given in Algorithm~\ref{alg:collapse}. The pseudocode, in particular, reveals an important exception (not covered in Figure~\ref{fig:collapsing}):
if $|v|=1$, then $\pref(\suff(v))$ is undefined and we just remove the pair of arcs $(\pref(v), v)$ and $(v, \suff(v))$.


%One simple property of the hierarchical graph is the following. 
%Let $v$ be a~node of length at least~2

%A~useful property of the hierarchical graph is the following: for any path from~$u$ to~$v$ that first goes up and then goes down, there is a~path from~$u$ to~$v$ that first goes down and then goes up and has exactly the same length. For example, on Figure~\ref{fig:hgex}(a), there is an up-down path ${\tt a} \to {\tt ae} \to {\tt aec} \to {\tt ec}$ and 
%a~down-up path ${\tt a} \to \varepsilon \to {\tt e} \to {\tt ec}$.
%This may be viewed as a~commutative diagram: to get~$v$ from~$u$, one needs to cut $\pref(u, v)$ and to append $\suff(u,v)$ and these two operations may be performed in any order. 
%Clearly, the top node of the up-down path is the superstring of~$u$ and~$v$, whereas the bottom node of the down-up path is the overlap of~$u$ and~$v$.

%Formally, after doubling every arc of~$D$, we start processing the nodes of the hierarchical graph level by level in the descending order, and in the lexicographic order on every level. If for the current node~$v$ there is a~pair of arcs $(\pref(v), v), (v, \suff(v)) \in D$, we replace it by a~pair of arcs $(\pref(v), \pref(\suff(v))), (\pref(\suff(v)), \suff(v))$ if $D$~remains to be a~solution (i.e., it is still connected). There is one exception for this: if $|v|=1$, then $\pref(\suff(v))$ is undefined and we just remove the pair of arcs. 
%A~formal pseudocode of this collapsing procedure is given in Algorithm~\ref{alg:collapse}. This way, the algorithm drops down all arcs of the doubled set~$D$ that are not needed for connectivity. See Algorithm~\ref{alg:ca} for a~formal pseudocode.

It drops down all pairs of arcs that are not needed for connectivity.

It is easy to show (we prove this formally in Claim~\ref{claim:zigzag} on page~\pageref{claim:zigzag}) that any normalized solution is of the form~\eqref{eq:zigzag}. But it is not true that every zig-zag solution of the form~\eqref{eq:zigzag} is a normalized solution: see Figure~\ref{fig:abnormalzigzag} for an example. The normalization procedure does not just turn a~solution into some standard form, but it may also improve it.
