\section{Hierarchical Solution properties}
In this section we prove some properties of Hierarchical Solution. Namely, in Section~\ref{sec:super} we prove that the Collapsing Algorithm is constant on the set of Eulerian supergraphs of HS. In Section~\ref{sec:gr_im_wcc} we prove that the standard Greedy Conjecture implies Weak Collapsing Conjecutre (which is sufficient for a simple 2-approximate greedy algorithm for SCS). Finally, it is easy to see that Collapsing Conjecture implies its weak version: indeed, if every doubled solution results in HS, then HS does not exceed twice the optimal superstring length. In Figure~\ref{fig:relations}, we show the proven relations between the conjectures, together with 2-approximate algorithm which follow from each of the conjecture.

In both aforementioned Sections we will use the following simple property of HS:
\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:property}
    Consider arbitrary vertex $v$ such that a pair of arcs $p = ((\pref(v), v), (v, \suff(v)))$ contains in HS. By definition of CA it means that collapsing this pair would disconnect the HS. Denote the component to which $v$ would belong if this disconnection occurred by $\mathcal{C}$. The following claims hold:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[\bf 1.] the arcs of $p$ are the only arcs connecting $v$ with the level $|v|-1$;
        \item[\bf 2.] the vertex $v$ is the lexicographically largest among all shortest nodes in $\mathcal{C}$.
    \end{itemize}    
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Denote by $t$ the moment right before CA finished processing $v$. Suppose that at this moment there was at least one arc $e$ of the form $(\pref(v), v)$ or $(v, \suff(v))$ in addition to the pair $p$. Note, that then, after collapsing $p$, HS would remain Eulerian and $v$ would remain weakly connected to both vertices $\pref(v)$ and $\suff(v)$ by $e$ and collapsed $p$. As the weak connectivity in Eulerian graphs tantamount the strong connectivity, then collapsing $p$ would not disconnect HS, so CA could collapse it, which contradicts the definition of $t$. This contradiction completes the proof of {\bf 1}.
    
    Now suppose that in $\mathcal{C}$ there was a node on the level less than $|v|$ or on the level $|v|$ but lexicographically larger than $v$. Then at the moment $t$ this node was immediately connected to $\varepsilon$, as it holds in $T(\mathcal{S})$, so $p$ could be safely collapsed, which again contradicts the definition of $t$. Thus, the proof of {\bf 2} is complete.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Constancy of Collapsing Algorithm on the set of HS supergraphs}
\label{sec:super}

 \begin{theorem}
For any set of strings $\mathcal{S}$ and any Eulerian graph $G$ which is also supergraph of $HS(\mathcal{S})$,
\[
			CA(\mathcal{S}, G) = HS(\mathcal{S}) \, .
\]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let us denote the complement $G \setminus HS$ by $\overline{HS}$. We will prove the theorem statement by showing that $CA(HS \sqcup \overline{HS})$ collapses all arcs of $\overline{HS}$ and keeps untouched the arcs of $HS$.  For clarity, we color the arcs of $HS$ in red and the arcs of $\overline{HS}$ in blue and without loss of generality assume that the Collapsing Algorithm collapses blue arcs first, that is, if for a vertex $v$, $CA$ can collapse a blue pair of arcs $(\pref(v), v), (v, \suff(v))$, it does so. Recall that $CA$ processes vertices in the descending order of levels (Algorithm~\ref{alg:ca}, line~\ref{alg:ca_for}). We will prove that before processing level $l$, all the arcs above it (i.e., the arcs with at least one vertex at a level  $>l$) do satisfy the desired property: all blue arcs are collapsed, and all red arcs are untouched.

The base case trivially holds for $l := \max\{|s| \, : \, s\in\mathcal{S}\}$, since the set of arcs above the level $l$ is empty. Assume the claim is true for the level $k > 0$, and let us prove the claim for the level $k - 1$. Note that regardless of the number of collapse operations applied to $\overline{HS}$, $\overline{HS}$ remains a set of walks: indeed, the collapse procedure keeps the balance of incoming and outgoing arcs for each vertex. By the induction hypothesis all the blue arcs above the level $k$ are collapsed, so we have that if for a vertex $v$ at level $k$ there is an arc $(\pref(v), v)$ in $\overline{HS}$, then there is also an arc $(v, \suff(v))$ in $\overline{HS}$, and vice versa. Recall that $CA$ collapses blue arcs when possible, and since every vertex has the same number of blue incoming and outgoing arcs, all pairs collapsed at the level $k$ are monotone. 
	
Now let us show that no red pair can be collapsed. Indeed, if for some vertex $v$ at level $k$ there is a red pair $(\pref(v), v)$, $(v, \suff(v))$, then by construction of $HS$ $v$ is either in $\mathcal{S}$ or is the last chance of the corresponding component $\mathcal{C} \ni v$ to be connected to the remaining arcs in $HS$ (note that the first case is a subcase of the second one, as then $\mathcal{C}$ contains only one vertex). It follows that if $CA$ collapses such a pair of arcs, then $v$ has no blue arcs (as they have been collapsed before the red arcs), and all other vertices in the component $\mathcal{C}$ at the level $k$ collapsed all arcs (since $v$ is the last vertex in $\mathcal{C}$ in lexicographic order, thanks to the lemma~\ref{lemma:property}). Therefore, this pair is also the last chance of $\mathcal{C}$ to be connected to the rest of the arcs in $HS$, thus, $CA$ cannot collapse it.
	
It remains to show that all blue pairs at level $k$ are collapsed. This trivially holds because no red pair is collapsed, and, thus, the connectivity of $HS \sqcup \overline{HS}$ is maintained by $HS$. This finishes the proof.
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}
    $CA(\mathcal{S}, HS(\mathcal{S})\sqcup HS(\mathcal{S})) = HS(\mathcal{S})$, so the Collapsing Conjecture holds at least for~HS.
\end{corollary}


\subsection{Greedy Implies Weak Collapsing}
\label{sec:gr_im_wcc}
Consider a~permutation of the input strings. We say that it is a~{\em valid greedy permutation} if it can be constructed by the Greedy Algorithm: there exist $n-1$ merges of the $n$~input strings that lead to this permutation such that at every step the two merged strings have the largest overlap. We will prove that HS is always a solution which corresponds to a greedy permutation of the input string. That is, while the standard Greedy Algorithm does not determine how to break ties, the Collapsing Algorithm applied to the trivial superstring is a specific instantiation of the Greedy Algorithm with some tie-breaking rule.

%We will use the following simple property of solutions constructed by the GHA algorithm.
%\begin{claim}
%\label{claim:zigzag}
%Let $D$ be an Eulerian solution constrtucted by GHA. Then $D$ has a ``zig-zag'' form as in~\eqref{eq:zigzag}. 
%\end{claim}
%\begin{proof}
%First we prove that $D$ is normalized, that is, any application of the collapsing procedure of Algorithm~\ref{alg:collapse} to $D$ will violate the property of Eulerian solution. Indeed, Algorithm~\ref{alg:collapse} can only collapse pairs of arcs of the form $(\pref(s), s), (s, \suff(s))$. The Greedy Hierarchical Algorithm adds such pairs to its solution in two cases: (i) $s$ is an input string (line~\ref{alg:gha_init} of Algorithm~\ref{algo:gha}); (ii) $s$ is the the lexicographically largest among the shortest strings in its Eulerian component (line~\ref{alg:last} of Algorithm~\ref{algo:gha}). Now note that in the former case, the collapsing procedure applied to $s$ would violate the property that $D$ must contain all input strings, and in the latter case, the collapsing procedure would violate the connectivity property of $D$.
%
%We finish the proof by showing that every normalized solution is of the form~\eqref{eq:zigzag}. Let $\pi=(s_1, \dots, s_n)$ be  the permutation of the input strings corresponding to a normalized Eulerian solution~$D$. Let us follow the arcs of~$D$ in the order of the permutation $\pi$, and let $P$ be the set of arcs between the input strings $s_i$ and $s_{i+1}$. We will prove that $P$ is the union of the sets of arcs of the paths $s_i \to \overlap(s_i,s_{i+1})$ and $\overlap(s_i,s_{i+1})\to s_{i+1}$. If $P$ contains a pair of consecutive up- and down-arcs, that is, there exists a pair of arcs $(\pref(s), s), (s, \suff(s))$ in $P$, then this pair would have been collapsed by Algorithm~\ref{alg:collapse}, line~\ref{alg:col}. Therefore, the path $P$ consists of a number of down-arcs followed by a number of up-arcs. It remains to show that the number of down-arcs in $P$ is $d=|s_i|-|\overlap(s_i,s_{i+1})|$. Note that by the definition of $\overlap(\cdot,\cdot)$, the number of down-arcs in~$P$ is at least~$d$. On the other hand, if the number of down-arcs in~$P$ is strictly greater than~$d$, then both the down-path and up-path in~$P$ contain the vertex $\overlap(s_i, s_{i+1})$. This implies that the pair of arcs  $(\pref(s), s), (s, \suff(s))$ for $s=\overlap(s_i, s_{i+1})$ would have been collapsed by Algorithm~\ref{alg:collapse}, line~\ref{alg:col}, as it does not violate the connectivity of the solution. Therefore, the number of down-arcs in $P$ is exactly $d$, which implies that $P$ is the path $s_i \to \overlap(s_i,s_{i+1})$ followed by the path $\overlap(s_i,s_{i+1})\to s_{i+1}$.
%\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:gr_im_wghc}
Every permutation $\pi=(s_1, \dots, s_n)$ of the input strings constructed according to HS is a~valid greedy permutation.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Consider the following algorithm~$A$: it starts with the sequence $(s_1, \dots, s_n)$ obtained from HS, and at every step it merges two neighboring strings in this sequence that have the largest overlap. It is a~greedy algorithm, but instead of considering all pairwise overlaps, it only considers overlaps of neighboring strings in the sequence. Of course, in the end, this algorithm constructs exactly the permutation~$\pi$. To show that $\pi$ is a~valid greedy permutation, we show that at every iteration of~$A$ no two strings have longer overlap than the two strings merged by~$A$.

Consider, for the sake of contradiction, the first iteration when the algorithm $A$~merges some pair of neighboring strings with overlap of length~$k$ whereas there are non-neighboring strings~$p$ and~$q$ with $v=\overlap(p,q)$, $|v|>k$. 
%Further assume that this is the earliest such iteration. 
At this point, $p$~is a~merger of input strings $s_a, s_{a+1}, \dotsc, s_b$
and $q$~is a~merger of input strings $s_c, s_{c+1}, \dotsc, s_d$. 
Then, from the assumption that no input string contains another input string, we have that $v=\overlap(p,q)=\overlap(s_b,s_c)$. Since the algorithm~$A$
merges neighboring strings in the decreasing order of overlap lengths, we have that $|\overlap(s_b,s_{b+1})| \le k <|v|$ and $|\overlap(s_{c-1},c_c)| \le k < |v|$.\footnote{In the case when $s_b$ is the last string in the solution (or $s_c$ is the first string in the solution) we think of it being followed by $\varepsilon$, and $|\overlap(s_b,\varepsilon)|=0<|v|$ still holds.} 

By definition of CA, HS has a ``zig-zag'' form, thus, it contains all arcs from the path $s_b\to\overlap(s_{b}, s_{b+1}) \to s_{b+1}$, and all arcs from the path $s_{c-1}\to\overlap(s_{c-1}, s_{c}) \to s_{c}$. Recall that $v=\overlap(s_b,s_c)$, and that $|\overlap(s_b,s_{b+1})| <|v|$ and $|\overlap(s_{c-1},s_c)|< |v|$. In particular, the paths $s_b\to\overlap(s_{b}, s_{b+1})$ and $\overlap(s_{c-1}, s_{c}) \to s_{c}$ pass through the vertex $v$, which implies that the vertex $v$ in HS has at least one incoming arc from the previous level and at least one outgoing arc to the previous level (see~Figure~\ref{fig:gagha}(a)). Such a~pair of arcs in HS may only occur when~$v$ is the last chance of its connected component to be connected to the rest of the solution. By the lemma~\ref{lemma:property}, this, in turn, implies that right before the pair of arcs $(\pref(v), v)$ and $(v, \suff(v))$ was processed, there was an~Eulerian component where $v$~was the lexicographically largest among all shortest nodes (this component is shown schematically in~Figure~\ref{fig:gagha}(b)) and thus all overlap-nodes (the nodes which are equal to $\overlap(s_i,s_{i+1})$) of this component lie on levels~$\geq k$. Note that the pair $(\pref(v), v)$ and $(v, \suff(v))$ is contained in HS in a single copy. Therefore, any path following the arcs of HS, after going through the arc $(\pref(v), v)$ must traverse the overlying component containing $s_b$ and $s_c$ (as otherwise the path could not reach the overlying component). In turn, this implies that after considering all overlaps of length $|v|>k$, $s_b$ and $s_c$ are already merged into one string, so they cannot be merged at this stage.
%It will be proven later (in Lemma~\ref{lem:edgecases}) that the resulting solution will include only one copy of arcs $(\pref(v), v)$ and $(v, \suff(v))$. Summing up, the vertex $v$ can be firstly traversed by any Eulerian path only using the arc $(\pref(v), v)$, and after this the overlying component containing $s_b$ and $s_c$ will be fully traversed, otherwise the graph will be disconnected.
%In turn, this means that after considering all overlaps of length $|v|$ $s_b$ and $s_c$ will be already merged into some string, so they can't be merged once more.
%This contradicts the assumption that the strings~$p$ and~$q$ can be merged.

Theorem~\ref{thm:gr_im_wghc} has two immediate corollaries.
\begin{corollary}
The Greedy Conjecture implies the Weak Collapsing Conjecture: if the Greedy Algorithm is 2-approximate, then so is the Hierarchical Solution.
\end{corollary}
Since every valid greedy permutation is a $3.5$-approximation to the Shortest Common Superstring problem~\cite{KS2005}, we have the following corollary.
\begin{corollary}
HS is a factor $3.5$ approximate solution for the Shortest Common Superstring problem.
